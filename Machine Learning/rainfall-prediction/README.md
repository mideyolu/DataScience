# Rainfall Prediction in Australia

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on predicting rainfall in Australia. The project involves data preprocessing, exploration, and the application of various machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether there will be rainfall in Australia the following day based on meteorological data. The dataset used is sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## Contents

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - Handled missing data, outliers, and any anomalies in the dataset.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical format if necessary.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**

   - Implemented and applied the following classification algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Trees
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**

   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained each classifier using the training dataset.
   - Evaluated the performance of each classifier using metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and LogLoss.

4. **Comparison and Analysis:**
   - Compared the performance of different classifiers.

## Directory Structure

- **code:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for each step of the project.
- **data:** Includes the dataset used for training and testing.
- **images:** Contains visualizations or plots generated during the analysis.
